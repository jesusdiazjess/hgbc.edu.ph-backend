# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At FUSASIS, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to disclose any potential vulnerabilities you may find in our project responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us directly at fusasis@outlook.com. We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until we have had an opportunity to review and address it.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide us with the following:
* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* Any additional information that could help us understand and mitigate the issue.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 to 4 business days and will work diligently to investigate and resolve the issue promptly. We are committed to maintaining the security of our project and appreciate your assistance in helping us achieve this goal.

Thank you for helping to keep FUSASIS safe and secure.
